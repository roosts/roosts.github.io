Dear Github:

Unfortunately, I have forgotten my password for the roosts github user. I have no way to have a password reset sent, either because the roosts.org domain no longer exists. So, instead I am demonstrating that I have access to the account through my vegantriathlete github user. I'd love to remove the repositories and the roosts account. Will you please help me to do that?

Cheers,
Marc (vegantriathlete)
