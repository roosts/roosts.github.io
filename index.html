        <h3>Welcome to the website!</h3>
	<p>I'm just getting started creating the site on GitHub. So, bear with me while I get things in place.</p>
	<p>It looks like I will be converting this to use Jekyll. I'll need a bit of time to figure out how all of that all works.</p>
	<p>By the way, you can find everything at https://github.com/roosts/roosts.github.io</p>
	<p>I'm now in the process of cleaning stuff out of this directory in preparation to start using jekyll.</p>
	<p>I've got jekyll installed and I've pushed to the repo. Now I'm analyzing how [the jekyll site](http://jekyllrb.com) was built.
