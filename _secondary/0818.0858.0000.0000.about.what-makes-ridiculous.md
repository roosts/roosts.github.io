A ridiculously open site will share as much as is safe to share about the process of building and running the site, as well as all the resources surrounding the subject matter of the site. This does not mean that the site will share such details as the emails and passwords of the people who use the site. Some things that *may* be shared include:

* All source code used to develop the site
* The configuration and setup of the hosting infrastructure
* The tools and the process used to generate the content on the site
* Instruction on how to use the tools that were used to generate content on the site
* The amount of time that is spent to build the site, perhaps in the form of a timesheet
* The challenges encountered in building the site
* The mistakes that were made building the site
* How the site creator(s) learned about the subject matter of the site as well as how to build the site

The preceding list is meant to give an idea of the additional things a ridiculously open site could share, but it not necessarily all-inclusive nor a set of requirements that need to be met to achieve ridiculous openness.

The method of sharing all of the resources can include many different options, such as downloads, screen casts, public repositories and wikis.
