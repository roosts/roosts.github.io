Wait a minute! Am I really talking about *money*? What happened to the whole "Free" ideology?

Just because a site is made freely available doesn't mean that nobody had to pay for it. Nor does it mean that nobody should make any money from it.

The way that a R.O.O.S.T. Site can be monitized will vary greatly from site to site. A R.O.O.S.T. Site may be:

* advertiser supported or sponsored in some fashion.
* a data gathering engine that will compile statistics about how its users interact with the site that can be sold.
* a vehicle for establishing someone as an authority on a topic who will then charge to provide expert consultation on that topic.
* a platform for crowd-sourcing the creation of a retailable product.

Whether or how a site is monitized has no bearing on whether it is a legitimate R.O.O.S.T. Site.
