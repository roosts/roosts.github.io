Some people may feel uncomfortable with the use of the word Ridiculous. Do we really need to be Ridiculous? Seriously?

For those who would rather use a different word, it is acceptable to think of the acronym as Radically Open or Refreshingly Open. In any case, it is *not* necessary to view the openness of a site as some type of competition. If the creator(s) of a site choose(s) to be less than ridiculously open, that need not be considered a shortcoming of the site or a sign of a character flaw in the creator(s).

Being ridiculously open is meant to set a standard for the ideal.
