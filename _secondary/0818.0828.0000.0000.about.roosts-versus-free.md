While all R.O.O.S.T.S. will be "Free" not all free sites are R.O.O.S.T.S.

R.O.O.S.T.S. are free, as in speech, as well as free, as in beer. Additionally, the "ridiculously open" aspect means that they will teach much more than just the specific subject matter at hand. R.O.O.S.T.S. will lay bare the entire process around creating the site itself. They provide a much richer organic experience to learn, since the site becomes a subject worth studying if an individual desires to do so.
